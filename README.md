 an automated tool to find open redirection ! still in development
 
   -> click on "view code" ^ located above to access the directory content or clone the tool to use it .
   
                    Initial Things:
                    
    [*] paste a "text file" consisting of urls in the O-Redirector directory

    [*] check "xsslogabhi" directory ( it is located at the place where the tool also located ) and check for logs : 
1. "O-Redirector-30x.txt" logs consists of all redirection logs , you can manually check for redirection if tool fails to identify  .
2. "O-Redirector-results" consists of open redirection logs,congrats you found an open redirect ! , have an eye on both logs !

Tip : press 'livemode' instead of filename when asking for files ,it will activate the livemode operation ! ( individual url check)

                     Usage in cmd/terminal:
    [*]  cd O-Redirector
    [*]  python3 o-redirector.py
    -> Then select your options
